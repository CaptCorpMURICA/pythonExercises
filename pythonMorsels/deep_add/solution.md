# Solution: deep_add
###### 12/09/2019

Hiya!

If you haven't attempted to solve deep_add yet, close this email and go do that now before reading on. If you have attempted solving deep_add, read on...

This week you needed to make a function that takes a nested list of numbers and adds up all the numbers given.

The simplest way to solve this exercise was through recursion.

Here's a solution that checks if the given value is a list and then recursively calls deep_add on each item in the list, iterating deeper or adding up items as we go:
```
def deep_add(list_or_number):
    """Return sum of values in given list, iterating deeply."""
    total = 0
    if type(list_or_number) == list:
        for x in list_or_number:
            total += deep_add(x)
        return total
    else:
        return list_or_number
```
Here we're allowing `deep_add` to be used with lists or numbers and then we're calling `deep_add` from within itself (calling a function inside itself is called recursion) to get sums of inner lists all the way down. Our "base case" in this recursion is the else clause (the "`list_or_number` is not a list" case).

We can do something similar without recursion, but it's a little trickier:
```
def deep_add(lists):
    """Return sum of values in given list, iterating deeply."""
    total = 0
    lists = list(lists)
    while lists:
        item = lists.pop()
        if isinstance(item, list):
            lists.extend(item)
        else:
            total += item
    return total
```
Here we're copying our original incoming lists to make sure the caller of our function doesn't get unhappy (if we didn't do this our original list would be modified because Python is [call-by-assignment](https://web.archive.org/web/20171108133127/https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/)).

Then we loop repeatedly until we've processed all the lists. Each time we loop we pop off the last item and either extend the list with it (if the last item was a list also) or add it to the total (if it was a number).

I'm going to focus on recursive solutions because they tend to be a little easier to work with for this problem.

Before we jump into the bonus, let's take a look at one way we could slightly rewrite our recursive solution:
```
def deep_add(list_or_number):
    """Return sum of values in given list, iterating deeply."""
    if type(list_or_number) == list:
        return sum(deep_add(x) for x in list_or_number)
    else:
        return list_or_number
```
Notice here that we're using the built-in sum function. The sum function accepts an iterable. The iterable we're passing it is a generator object that we're making with the generator expression `(deep_add(x) for x in list_or_number)`. Because we're summing up our numbers using the sum function, we're able to remove our `total = 0` and `return total` and `total +=` and in fact we've removed the total variable entirely.

Note that we're able to leave off the extra pair of parenthesis that would normally be around our generator expression. Instead of `sum((deep_add(x) for x in list_or_number))` we've written just `sum(deep_add(x) for x in list_or_number)`. When a generator expression is the only thing inside a set of parenthesis, Python allows you to drop the extra parenthesis.

If we really wanted to, we could even use an inline if statement in this function:
```
def deep_add(list_or_number):
    """Return sum of values in given list, iterating deeply."""
    return (
        sum(deep_add(x) for x in list_or_number)
        if type(list_or_number) == list
        else list_or_number
    )
```
That's up to personal style though. I don't find this solution more readable than the one before it.

## Bonus #1
Okay let's attempt the first bonus now.

The first bonus asked that we accept any iterable to our function, not just lists.

Our current code won't work for this case because we're doing an `isinstance` check to see if the given argument is a list. In Python we often practice the principle "it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission" ([EAFP](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-eafp)). We could embrace this paradigm and attempt to loop over the given argument and then handle an exception if the argument isn't an iterable:
```
def deep_add(iterable_or_number):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    try:
        return sum(deep_add(x) for x in iterable_or_number)
    except TypeError:
        return iterable_or_number
```
This passes our first bonus! But it fails one of our other tests. When we pass invalid values like `None`, a `TypeError` should be raised. It isn't right now.

We're not seeing a `TypeError` raised for invalid values because we're currently suppressing type errors everywhere in our loop, including when we use the `+=` operator on our items!

We could go back to using an `if` statement but flip our logic around, checking for numbers instead of lists:
```
def deep_add(iterable_or_number):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    if isinstance(iterable_or_number, (int, float, complex)):
        return iterable_or_number
    else:
        return sum(deep_add(x) for x in iterable_or_number)
```
This also passes our bonus, but it fails one of our tests also. This solution fails for numeric types outside of the ones we specified, like `decimal.Decimal`. We could try to keep track of all possible numeric types and put them in that tuple in our `isinstance` check, but we can't possibly get all of them (especially since it's possible to invent your own).

We can fix this problem by relying on the `Number` abstract base class in the `numbers` module:
```
from numbers import Number

def deep_add(iterable_or_number):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    if isinstance(iterable_or_number, Number):
        return iterable_or_number
    else:
        return sum(deep_add(x) for x in iterable_or_number)
```
It's considered a best practice for all numeric types to register themselves with this abstract base class, so our code should work for numeric types this way.

## Bonus #2
Let's tackle the second bonus now.

For the second bonus, we were supposed to accept an optional `start` argument that would change the start value of our sum (which should default to `0`).
```
from numbers import Number

def deep_add(iterable_or_number, start=0):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    if isinstance(iterable_or_number, Number):
        return iterable_or_number
    else:
        total = start
        for x in iterable_or_number:
            total += deep_add(x)
        return total
```
Here we're doing the same thing we were doing before, but we've added a `start` argument that defaults to 0 and we're using that to initialize our `total` variable.

Notice that I've moved back to the `for` loop `+=` approach instead of using a generator expression with the sum function here. We could move back to using the sum function if we pass in the start to our sum call:
```
from numbers import Number

def deep_add(iterable_or_number, start=0):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    if isinstance(iterable_or_number, Number):
        return iterable_or_number
    else:
        return sum((deep_add(x) for x in iterable_or_number), start)
```
Notice that we have to add back the parenthesis around our generator expression because it's not the only thing in the sum function call. That's unfortunate, but I still find this more readable than our loop approach.

Cool! That bonus was probably a bit simpler than the first one.

## Bonus #3
Let's take a look at the third bonus.

For this bonus we were supposed to make sure our `deep_add` works even for pseudo-numeric types like `datetime.timedelta`. It can sometimes be handy to add up types that aren't strictly numbers but do operate like numbers with the `+` operator.

We've already determined that we can't do an `isinstance` check to see if the argument given to us is a list and we also can't do an `isinstance` check to see whether it's a number. We also know that we can't try to loop over it and handle `TypeError` because that also caught `TypeError` exceptions raised from addition.

We could try to check if the given argument is an iterable though. If you've read my article on [how for loops work in Python](http://treyhunner.com/2016/12/python-iterator-protocol-how-for-loops-work/), you know that you can get an iterator from any iterable by using the built-in `iter` function. So if we call iter on the argument given to us and we don't get a `TypeError`, we know that we're working with an iterable. Let's make a function that uses that fact:
```
def deep_add(iterable_or_number, start=0):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    try:
        iter(iterable_or_number)
    except TypeError:
        return iterable_or_number
    else:
        return sum((deep_add(x) for x in iterable_or_number), start)
```
Here we're attempting to get an iterator from the argument given to us. If a `TypeError` occurs while we're doing that, we'll treat the argument as a number. If no exceptions occurred (that's what try-else means), then we'll loop over the argument and recursively add up its items.

You might instead decide to get clever and not actually call `iter` but instead check to see whether our iterable has a `__iter__`:
```
def deep_add(iterable_or_number, start=0):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    if hasattr(iterable_or_number, '__iter__'):
        return sum((deep_add(x) for x in iterable_or_number), start)
    else:
        return iterable_or_number
```
Unfortunately, this doesn't quite pass our tests. The problem is that we need to send `start` into all our recursive `deep_add` calls because the "numbers" given to us might not actually be numbers and might not be addable to `0` (e.g. `datetime.timedelta(5) + 0` raises an exception).

To do that we'll need to keep track of a running sum:
```
def deep_add(iterable_or_number, start=0):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    if hasattr(iterable_or_number, '__iter__'):
        total = start
        for x in iterable_or_number:
            total = deep_add(x, start=total)
        return total
    else:
        return iterable_or_number + start
```
We need to use a `for` loop instead of a generator expression here because of that `total` variable we need to keep updating and then using again.

While this `__iter__` check works for most iterables, it doesn't necessarily work for all iterables. It's possible to make a sequence without specifying a `__iter__`.

Don't rely on `__dunder__` method checking unless you _really_ understand how the high-level operations (like the `iter` function) interact with and rely on the various dunder methods (like `__iter__`).

There is a better way to test for iterability without directly calling the `iter` function. We can check whether the class we're using inherits from the `Iterable` abstract base class from the `collections.abc` module:
```
from collections.abc import Iterable


def deep_add(numbers, start=0):
    """Return sum of values in given iterable, iterating deeply."""
    total = start
    for value in numbers:
        if isinstance(value, Iterable):
            total = deep_add(value, start=total)
        else:
            total += value
    return total
```
We've also changed our `total` usage a bit here.

Now you might think "wait a minute... if things can be number-like but not inherit from `numbers.Number`, won't we have the same problem with `collections.abc.Iterable` and custom iterables?" And this is a valid point!

It's a valid point, but that's actually not how `collections.abc.Iterable` works. If we make an `Iterable` that doesn't inherit from `collections.abc.Iterable`, it will still answer `True` to the question `isinstance(custom_iterable, Iterable)`:
```
>>> class I:
...     def __iter__(self):
...         return iter([])
...
>>> x = I()
>>> from collections.abc import Iterable
>>> isinstance(x, Iterable)
True
```
This is a little odd. Normally `isinstance` only answers `True` if objects actually inherit from the given type. But the `Iterable` class uses a metaclass `abc.ABCMeta`, which defines a `__subclasscheck__` that allows `Iterable` to customize the behavior of `isinstance`.

So the behavior of the `isinstance` function in Python is actually customizable for different types, the same way `len` and `iter` are!

So we're actually practicing "duck typing" (checking whether our iterable is actually an iterable) and not strict type checking here.

If this section on `isinstance`, `Iterable`, duck typing, and meta classes didn't make sense, don't worry. This is pretty advanced stuff we just did and while it's interesting to know about, it's definitely not essential to understand deeply. Feel free to email me questions on this.

I hope you learned something from these solutions!
